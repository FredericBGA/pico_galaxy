Obsolete
========

This tool is now obsolete, having been replaced	by a more general version
covering the FASTA, FASTQ and SFF sequence formats in a single tool. You
should only install this tool if you need to support existing workflows
which used it.

Galaxy tool to filter FASTQ sequences by ID
===========================================

This tool is copyright 2010 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Galaxy library functions) which
divides a FASTQ file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present in
the specified column(s) of a tabular file. Example uses include filtering based
on search results from a tool like NCBI BLAST before assembly.

There are just two files to install:

* fastq_filter_by_id.py (the Python script)
* fastq_filter_by_id.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is next to the similarly named fastq_filter.py and
fastq_filter.xml files which are included with Galaxy, i.e. in the Galaxy
folder tools/fastq

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. The suggested location is next to the fastq_filter.xml entry. Simply
add the line:

<tool file="fastq/fastq_filter_by_id.xml" />

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial verion (not publicly released)
v0.0.2 - Allow both, just pos or just neg output files
       - Preserve the FASTQ variant in the XML wrapper
v0.0.3 - Fixed bug when generating non-matching FASTQ file only
v0.0.4 - Deprecated, marked as hidden in the XML


Developers
==========

This script and similar versions for FASTA and SFF files are currently being
developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf fastq_filter_by_id.tar.gz tools/fastq/fastq_filter_by_id.*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf fastq_filter_by_id.tar.gz
fastq/fastq_filter_by_id.py
fastq/fastq_filter_by_id.txt
fastq/fastq_filter_by_id.xml
