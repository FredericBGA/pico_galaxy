Galaxy tool to divide FASTQ files into paired and unpaired reads
================================================================

This tool is copyright 2010 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Biopython library functions) which
divides a FASTQ file into paired reads, and single or orphan reads. You can have
separate files for the forward/reverse reads, or have them interleaved in a
single file.

Note that the FASTQ variant is unimportant (Sanger, Solexa, Illumina, or even
Color Space should all work equally well).

There are just two files to install:

* fastq_paired_unpaired.py (the Python script)
* fastq_paired_unpaired.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/fastq next to other FASTQ
tools provided with Galaxy.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. One suggested location is next to the fastq_filter.xml entry. Simply
add the line:

<tool file="fastq/fastq_paired_unpaired.xml" />

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version, using Biopython
v0.0.2 - Help text; cope with multiple pairs per template
v0.0.3 - Galaxy XML wrappers added
v0.0.4 - Use Galaxy library to handle FASTQ files (avoid Biopython dependency)
v0.0.5 - Handle Illumina 1.8 style pair names
v0.0.6 - Record script version when run from Galaxy
       - Added unit test (FASTQ file using Sanger naming)


Developers
==========

This script and other tools for filtering FASTA, FASTQ and SFF files are
currently being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf fastq_paired_unpaired.tar.gz tools/fastq/fastq_paired_unpaired.* test-data/sanger-pairs-*.fastq

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf fastq_paired_unpaired.tar.gz

fastq/fastq_paired_unpaired.xml
