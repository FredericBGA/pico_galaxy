Galaxy tool to primer clip (trim) FASTA, FASTQ or SFF reads
===========================================================

This tool is copyright 2011 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Galaxy library functions and
Biopython). There are just two files to install:

* seq_primer_clip.py (the Python script)
* seq_primer_clip.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is a new tools/primers folder. You will also need to
modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool. 

<tool file="primers/seq_primer_clip.xml" />

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version (not publicly released)
v0.0.2 - Sort primers by length (longest and therefore most specific first)
v0.0.3 - Consider missing bases at start/end of read as mismatches
v0.0.4 - Apply minimum length to sequences with no match too


Developers
==========

This script and similar tools for FASTA, FASTQ and SFF files are currently
being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf seq_primer_clip.tar.gz tools/primers/seq_primer_clip.*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf seq_primer_clip.tar.gz
primers/seq_primer_clip.xml
primers/seq_primer_clip.py
primers/seq_primer_clip.txt
