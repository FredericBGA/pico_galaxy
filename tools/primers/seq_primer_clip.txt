Galaxy tool to primer clip (trim) FASTA, FASTQ or SFF reads
===========================================================

This tool is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Galaxy library functions and
Biopython). There are just two files to install:

* seq_primer_clip.py (the Python script)
* seq_primer_clip.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is a new tools/primers folder. You will also need to
modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool:

<tool file="primers/seq_primer_clip.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder. Then:

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id seq_primer_clip

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version (not publicly released)
v0.0.2 - Sort primers by length (longest and therefore most specific first)
v0.0.3 - Consider missing bases at start/end of read as mismatches
v0.0.4 - Apply minimum length to sequences with no match too
v0.0.5 - Count clipped & non-matched short reads separately, length bug fixes
v0.0.6 - Added some functional tests
v0.0.7 - Added error check for bad filename arguments
v0.0.8 - Record version of Python script when run from Galaxy.
       - Check for errors using Python script's return code.
v0.0.9 - Moved test data to workaround Galaxy Tool Shed limititation.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

This incorporates the previously used hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf seq_primer_clip.tar.gz tools/primers/seq_primer_clip.* test-data/dop_primers.fasta test-data/MID4_GLZRM4E04_rnd30*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf seq_primer_clip.tar.gz
