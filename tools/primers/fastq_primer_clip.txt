Galaxy tool to primer clip (trim) FASTQ reads
=============================================

This tool is copyright 2011 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Galaxy library functions).
There are just two files to install:

* fastq_primer_clip.py (the Python script)
* fastq_primer_clip.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is a new tools/primers folder. You will also need to
modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool. 

<tool file="primers/fastq_primer_clip.xml" />

That's it.
