Galaxy wrapper for Command line NoD predictor (v1.3)
====================================================

This wrapper is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

Command line NoD predictor is a tool for predicting nucleolar localization
sequences (NoLSs) in a FASTA file of proteins using a neural network. There
is also a webtool version at http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/

This NoD wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/clinod


Installation
============
This wrapper expects the java binary to be on the system PATH, and to be able
to access command line NoD as /opt/clinod/clinod-1.3.jar (edit clinod.xml if
you wish to use a different location).

Internally NoD calls the binary batchman from the Stuttgart Neural Network
Simulator (SNNS) v 4.2 software suite. This binary can either be on the system
path or located next to the JAR file, i.e. /opt/clinod/batchman

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/protein_analysis folder:

* clinod.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* clinod.txt (this README file)

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line:

<tool file="protein_analysis/clinod.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder.

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id clinod

That's it.


History

Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf clinod.tar.gz tools/protein_analysis/clinod.xml tools/protein_analysis/clinod.txt test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.clinod-1.3.tabular

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf clinod.tar.gz
tools/protein_analysis/clinod.xml
tools/protein_analysis/clinod.txt
test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
test-data/four_human_proteins.clinod-1.3.tabular
