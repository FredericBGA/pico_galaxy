Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the Jar files for effectiveT3 v1.0.1 and the three models (animal, plant and std).


Manual Installation
===================

You can change the path by setting the environment variable EFFECTIVET3 to the
relevant folder, but by default it expects the following files to be installed
at these locations:

/opt/EffectiveT3/TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_ANIMAL-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_PLANT-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_STD-1.0.1.jar

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/effectiveT3 folder:

* effectiveT3.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* effectiveT3.py (the Python wrapper script)
* effectiveT3.txt (this README file)

Also copy effectiveT3.loc.sample to effectiveT3.loc in the tool-data folder
(and edit if appropriate, e.g. to add or remove a model).

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line:

<tool file="effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder.

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id effectiveT3

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.7 - Initial public release
v0.0.8 - Include effectiveT3.loc.sample in Tool Shed
v0.0.9 - Check the return code for errors in the XML
v0.0.10- Added unit test
v0.0.11- Automated installation
       - Record version of Python script when called from Galaxy


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf effectiveT3.tar.gz tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.py tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.txt tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular test-data/empty.fasta test-data/empty_effectiveT3.tabular


Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf effectiveT3.tar.gz
tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml
tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.py
tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.txt
tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample
test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular
test-data/empty.fasta
test-data/empty_effectiveT3.tabular
