description: Rename sequences with ID mapping from a tabular file
long_description: |
  Allows you to rename sequences in FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ or SFF files.

  The renaming rules are given by two columns of a tabular file (old names and new
  names). Any sequence not mentioned in the tabular file keeps its current name.

  This tool requires Biopython for working with SFF files.

  See also my related tools to filter sequences by ID, or select sequences by ID.
