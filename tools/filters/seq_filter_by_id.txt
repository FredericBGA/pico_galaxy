Galaxy tool to filter FASTA, FASTQ or SFF sequences by ID
=========================================================

This tool is copyright 2010-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using both the Galaxy and Biopython library
functions) which divides a FASTA, FASTQ, or SFF file in two, those sequences with
or without an ID present in the specified column(s) of a tabular file. Example uses
include filtering based on search results from a tool like NCBI BLAST before
assembly.

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id

Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, provided you have installed Biopython 1.54 or later.
Galaxy should automatically install the Python script, and run the unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install:

* seq_filter_by_id.py (the Python script)
* seq_filter_by_id.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/filters next to the tool
for calling sff_extract.py for converting SFF to FASTQ or FASTA + QUAL.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line:

<tool file="filters/seq_filter_by_id.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder. Then:

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id seq_filter_by_id

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version, combining three separate scripts for each file format.
v0.0.4 - Record script version when run from Galaxy.
       - Faster FASTA code which preserves the original line wrapping.
       - Basic unit test included.
v0.0.5 - Check for errors using Python script's return code.
       - Cope with malformed FASTA entries without an identifier.
v0.0.6 - Link to Tool Shed added to help text and this documentation.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

This incorporates the previously used hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf seq_filter_by_id.tar.gz tools/filters/seq_filter_by_id.* test-data/k12_ten_proteins.fasta test-data/k12_hypothetical.fasta test-data/k12_hypothetical.tabular

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf seq_filter_by_id.tar.gz
filter/seq_filter_by_id.py
filter/seq_filter_by_id.txt
filter/seq_filter_by_id.xml
test-data/k12_ten_proteins.fasta
test-data/k12_hypothetical.fasta
test-data/k12_hypothetical.tabular
