Galaxy tool to select FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ or SFF sequences by ID
===============================================================

This tool is copyright 2011 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython library functions) to extract
sequences from a FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ, or SFF file based on the list of IDs given
by a column of a tabular file. The output order follows that of the tabular file,
and if there are duplicates in the tabular file, there will be duplicates in the
output sequence file.

See also the sister tool to filter sequence files according to IDs from column(s)
of a tabular file, where the output order follows the sequence file, and any
duplicate IDs are ignored.

There are just two files to install:

* seq_select_by_id.py (the Python script)
* seq_select_by_id.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/filters next to the tool
for calling sff_extract.py for converting SFF to FASTQ or FASTA + QUAL.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line:

<tool file="filters/seq_select_by_id.xml" />

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf seq_select_by_id.tar.gz tools/filters/seq_select_by_id.*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf seq_select_by_id.tar.gz
filter/seq_select_by_id.py
filter/seq_select_by_id.txt
filter/seq_select_by_id.xml
