Galaxy tool to filter SFF sequences by ID
=========================================

This tool is copyright 2010 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Biopython library functions) which
divides an SFF file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present in
the specified column(s) of a tabular file. Example uses include filtering based
on search results from a tool like NCBI BLAST before assembly.

There are just two files to install:

* sff_filter_by_id.py (the Python script)
* sff_filter_by_id.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/filters next to the tool
for calling sff_extract.py for converting SFF to FASTQ or FASTA + QUAL.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. One suggested location is next to the sff_extractor.xml entry. Simply
add the line:

<tool file="filters/sff_filter_by_id.xml" />

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and similar versions for FASTA and FASTQ files are currently being
developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf sff_filter_by_id.tar.gz tools/filters/sff_filter_by_id.*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf sff_filter_by_id.tar.gz
filter/sff_filter_by_id.py
filter/sff_filter_by_id.txt
filter/sff_filter_by_id.xml
