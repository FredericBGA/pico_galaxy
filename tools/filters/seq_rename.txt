Galaxy tool to renamed FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ or SFF sequences
==========================================================

This tool is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython library functions) to rename
sequences from a FASTA, QUAL, FASTQ, or SFF file based on an ID mapping gives as
two columns of a tabular file. The output order follows that of the sequence file,
and if there are duplicates in the input sequence file, there will be duplicates
in the output sequence file.

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed,
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_rename

See also the sister tools to filter or select sequence files according to IDs
from column(s) of tabular file:

Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, provided you have installed Biopython 1.54 or later.
Galaxy should automatically install the Python script, and run the unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install:

* seq_rename.py (the Python script)
* seq_rename.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/filters next to the tool
for calling sff_extract.py for converting SFF to FASTQ or FASTA + QUAL.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line:

<tool file="filters/seq_rename.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder. Then:

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id seq_rename

You will also need to install Biopython 1.54 or later. That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version.
v0.0.2 - Record script version when run from Galaxy.
       - Add unit test.
       - Check for errors using Python script's return code.
v0.0.3 - Link to Tool Shed added to help text and this documentation.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf seq_rename.tar.gz tools/filters/seq_rename.* test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.tabular test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.fasta

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf seq_rename.tar.gz
tools/filter/seq_rename.py
tools/filter/seq_rename.txt
tools/filter/seq_rename.xml
test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.tabular
test-data/four_human_proteins.rename.fasta
