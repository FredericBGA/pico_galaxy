**What it does**

Takes an input file of sequences (typically FASTA or FASTQ, but also
Standard Flowgram Format (SFF) is supported), and returns a new sequence
file sub-sampling from this (in the same format).

Several sampling modes are supported, all designed to be non-random. This
allows reproducibility, and also works on paired sequence files.

The simplest mode is to take every N-th sequence, for example taking
every 2nd sequence would sample half the file - while taking every 5th
sequence would take 20% of the file.


**Example Usage**

Suppose you have some Illumina paired end data as files ``R1.fastq`` and
``R2.fastq`` which give an estimated x200 coverage, and you wish to do a
*de novo* assembly with a tool like MIRA which recommends lower coverage.
Taking every 3rd read would reduce the estimated coverage to about x66,
and would preserve the pairing as well.
