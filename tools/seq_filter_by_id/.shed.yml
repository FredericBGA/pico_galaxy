description: Filter sequences by ID
long_description: |
  Divide a FASTA, FASTQ or SFF file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present
  in the specified column(s) of a tabular file.

  Example uses include filtering based on search results from a tool like NCBI BLAST,
  TMHMM, SignalP, or a read mapper. i.e. Split your sequences according to whether
  or not they have a BLAST match, transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or map to
  the reference sequence.

  This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython and Galaxy library functions).
  It requires Biopython to be installed.

  Note this tool replaces my three previously separate tools for FASTA, FASTA and
  SFF filtering by ID.
