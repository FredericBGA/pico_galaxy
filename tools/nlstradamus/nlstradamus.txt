NLStradamus is a command line tools for predicting nuclear localization
signals (NLSs) in a FASTA file of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Early versions of NLStradamus did not have a native tabular output format, this
was added in version 1.7. Additionally a fast C++ implementation was added at
this point (early versions of NLStradamus came as a perl script only).

Version 1.8 fixed a C++ compilation issue on modern compilers, but is otherwise
unchanged.


Installation
============
This wrapper expects the compiled C++ binary "NLStradamus" to be on the system
PATH.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/protein_analysis folder:

* nlstradamus.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* nlstradamus.txt (this README file)

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line (matching the chosen install path):

<tool file="protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder. Then:

$ ./run_functional_tests.sh -id nlstradamus

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.3 - Initial public release
v0.0.4 - Adding DOI link to reference
         (Documentation change only)
v0.0.5 - Assume non-zero return codes are errors
v0.0.6 - Show output help text using a table
       - Added unit tests


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf nlstradmus.tar.gz tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.txt test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.nlstradamus.tabular test-data/empty.fasta test-data/empty_nlstradamus.tabular

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf nlstradmus.tar.gz
tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml
tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.txt
test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
test-data/four_human_proteins.nlstradamus.tabular
test-data/empty.fasta
test-data/empty_nlstradamus.tabular
