**What it does**

This calls the Promoter 2.0 tool for prediction of eukaryotic PolII promoter sequences using a Neural Network (NN) model.

The input is a FASTA file of nucleotide sequences (e.g. upstream regions of your genes), and the output is tabular with five columns (one row per promoter):

 1. Sequence identifier (first word of FASTA header)
 2. Promoter position, e.g. 600
 3. Promoter score, e.g. 1.063
 4. Promoter likelihood, e.g. Highly likely prediction

The scores are classified very simply as follows:

========= ========================
Score     Description
--------- ------------------------
below 0.5 ignored
0.5 - 0.8 Marginal prediction
0.8 - 1.0 Medium likely prediction
above 1.0 Highly likely prediction 
========= ========================

Internally the input FASTA file is divided into parts (to allow multiple processors to be used), and the raw output is reformatted into this tabular layout suitable for downstream analysis within Galaxy.
