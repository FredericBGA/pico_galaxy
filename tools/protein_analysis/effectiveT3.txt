Installation
============

You can change the path by editing the definition near the start of the Python
script effectiveT3.py, but by default it expects the following files to be
installed at these locations:

/opt/EffectiveT3/TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_ANIMAL-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_PLANT-1.0.1.jar
/opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_STD-1.0.1.jar

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/protein_analysis folder:

* effectiveT3.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* effectiveT3.py (the Python wrapper script)
* effectiveT3.txt (this README file)

Also copy effectiveT3.loc.sample to effectiveT3.loc in the tool-data folder
(and edit if appropriate, e.g. to add or remove a model).

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line:

<tool file="protein_analysis/effectiveT3.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also add this to tools_conf.xml.sample
and move/copy the test-data files under Galaxy's test-data folder.

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.7 - Initial public release
v0.0.8 - Include effectiveT3.loc.sample in Tool Shed
v0.0.9 - Check the return code for errors in the XML
v0.0.10- Added unit test


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf effectiveT3.tar.gz tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.xml tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.py tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.txt tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular


Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf effectiveT3.tar.gz
tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.xml
tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.py
tools/protein_analysis/effectiveT3.txt
tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample
test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular
