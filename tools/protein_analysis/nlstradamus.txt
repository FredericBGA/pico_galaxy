NLStradamus is a command line tools for predicting nuclear localization
signals (NLSs) in a FASTA file of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Early versions of NLStradamus did not have a native tabular output format, this
was added in version 1.7. Additionally a fast C++ implementation was added at
this point (early versions of NLStradamus came as a perl script only). This
wrapper expects the compiled C++ binary "NLStradamus" to be on the system PATH.

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/protein_analysis folder:

* nlstradamus.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* nlstradamus.txt (this README file)

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line:

<tool file="protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml" />

That's it.


History
=======

v0.0.3 - Initial public release
v0.0.4 - Adding DOI link to reference
         (Documentation change only)


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf nlstradmus.tar.gz tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.txt

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf nlstradmus.tar.gz
tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.xml
tools/protein_analysis/nlstradamus.txt
