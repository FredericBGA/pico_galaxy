**Background**

Many effector proteins from Oomycete plant pathogens for manipulating the host
have been found to contain a signal peptide followed by a conserved RXLR motif
(Arg, any amino acid, Leu, Arg), and then sometimes EER (Glu, Glu, Arg). There
are stiking parallels with the malarial host-targeting signal.


**What it does**

Takes a protein sequence FASTA file as input, and produces a simple tabular
file as output with one line per protein, and two columns giving the sequence
ID and whether or not it had the selected RXLR motif (Y or N).


**Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) RXLR Model**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR as described in Bhattacharjee et al. (2006).

Matches must have a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM) score of at least 0.9,
a SignalP Neural Network (NN) predicted clevage site giving a signal peptide
length between 10 and 40 amino acids inclusive, and the RXLR pattern must be
after but within 100 amino acids of the clevage site.
SignalP is run truncating the sequences to the first 70 amino acids, which was
the default on the SignalP webservice used in Bhattacharjee et al. (2006).


**Win et al. (2007) RXLR Model**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR as described in Win et al. (2007).

Matches must have a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM) score of at least 0.9,
a SignalP Neural Network (NN) predicted clevage site giving a signal peptide
length between 10 and 40 amino acids inclusive, and the RXLR pattern must be
after the clevage site and start between amino acids 30 and 60.
SignalP is run truncating the sequences to the first 70 amino acids, to match
the methodology of Torto et al. (2003) followed in Win et al. (2007).


**Whisson et al. (2007) RXLR-EER Heuristic Model only**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR-EER using the heuristic regular expression
methodolgy described in Whisson et al. (2007), which was an extension of the
RXLR clasffier described in Bhattacharjee et al. (2006).

All the requirements described above for Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) apply,
but rather than just looking for RXLR with the regular expression R.LR the
more complicated regular expression R.LR.{,40}[ED][ED][KR] is used. This means
RXLR (Arg, any amino acid, Leu, Arg), then a stretch of up to forty amino
acids before Glu/Asp, Glu/Asp, Lys/Arg. The EER part of the name is perhaps
misleading as it also allows for DDR, EEK, and so on.

Unlike Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) which used the SignalP webservice which
defaults to truncating the sequences at 70 amino acids, Whisson et al. (2007)
used the SignalP 3.0 command line tool with its default of not truncating the
sequences. This does alter some of the scores, and also takes a little longer.

Note that Whisson et al. (2007) also describes a second RXLR-EER classifier
which combines this with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), see below.

**Whisson et al. (2007) RXLR-ERR HMM only**

Doesn't run SignalP, just calls HMMER to look for a cross validated HMM
for the RXLR-ERR domain based on known positive examples. There are no
restrictions on where within the protein the HMM match must be found.


**Whisson et al. (2007) RXLR-EER including HMM**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR-EER as described in Whisson et al. (2007),
applying both the heuristic SignalP and regular expression approach based
on Bhattacharjee et al. (2006), and the HMMER HMM based on known positive
examples.

i.e. Combines the heuristic only and HMM only options above.


**Note**

Both Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) and Win et al. (2007) used SignalP v2.0, which
is no longer available. The current release is SignalP v3.0 (Mar 5, 2007), so
this is used instead. SignalP is called with the Eukaryote model and the short
output (one line per protein). Any sequence truncation (e.g. to 70 amino acids)
is handled via the intemediate sequence files.

Whisson et al. (2007) developed their HMM using HMMER 2.3.2 (Eddy 2008), which
has since been replaced by the faster HMMER 3 (which can still be run using the
HMMER 2 model with the HMMER 3 hmmsearch command line tool).
