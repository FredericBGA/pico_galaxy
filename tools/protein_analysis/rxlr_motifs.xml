**What it does**

Many effector proteins from Oomycete plant pathogens for manipulating the host have
been found to contain a signal peptide followed by a conserved RXLR motif (Arg, any
amino acid, Leu, Arg), and then sometimes EER (Glu, Glu, Arg). There are stiking
parallels with the malarial host-targeting signal.

It requires a protein sequence FASTA file as input, and produces a simple tabular
file as output with one line per protein, and two columns giving the sequence ID
and whether or not it had the selected RXLR motif (Y or N).


**Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) RXLR Model**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR as described in Bhattacharjee et al. (2006).

Matches must have a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM) score of at least 0.9,
a SignalP Neural Network (NN) predicted clevage site giving a signal peptide
length between 10 and 40 amino acids inclusive, and the RXLR pattern must be
after but within 100 amino acids of the clevage site.


**Win et al. (2007) RXLR Model**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR as described in Win et al. (2007).

Matches must have a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM) score of at least 0.9,
a SignalP Neural Network (NN) predicted clevage site giving a signal peptide
length between 10 and 40 amino acids inclusive, and the RXLR pattern must be
after the clevage site and start between amino acids 30 and 60.


**Whisson et al. (2007) RXLR-EER Heuristic Model**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR-EER using the heuristic regular expression
methodolgy described in Whisson et al. (2007), which was an extension of the RXLR
clasffier described in Bhattacharjee et al. (2006).

All the requirements described above for Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) apply,
but rather than just looking for RXLR with the regular expression R.LR the more
complicated regular expression R.LR.{,40}[ED][ED][KR] is used. This means
RXLR (Arg, any amino acid, Leu, Arg), then a stretch of up to forty amino acids
before Glu/Asp, Glu/Asp, Lys/Arg. The EER part of the name is perhaps misleading
as it also allows for DDR, EEK, and so on.

Note that Whisson et al. (2007) also describes a second RXLR-EER classifier using
a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).


**Note**

Both Bhattacharjee et al. (2006) and Win et al. (2007) used SignalP v2.0, which
is no longer available. The current release is SignalP v3.0 (Mar 5, 2007), so
this is used instead (with the Eukaryote model and sequences truncated at 70
amino acids).
