**What it does**

Many effector proteins from Oomycete plant pathogens for manipulating the host have
been found to contain a signal peptide followed by a conserved RXLR motif (Arg, any
amino acid, Leu, Arg), and then sometimes EER (Glu, Glu, Arg). There are stiking
parallels with the malarial host-targeting signal.

This tool looks or the protein motif RXLR using the methodolgy described in
Bhattacharjee et al. (2006). It requires a protein sequence FASTA file as input, and
produces a simple tabular file as output with one line per protein, and two columns
giving the sequence ID and whether or not it had an RXLR motif (Y or N).

Declaring a protein to have an RXLR motif requires a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
score of at least 0.9, with the Neural Network predicted cleavage site giving a signal
peptide length between 10 and 40 amino acids, with an RXLR pattern after this and
starting within 100 amino acids of the signal peptide clevage site.

Note that Bhattacharjee et al. (2007) used SignalP v2.0, which is no longer available.
The current release is SignalP v3.0 (Mar 5, 2007), so this is used instead (with the
Eukaryote model and sequences truncated at 70 amin acids).

See also Whisson et. al (2007) which extends this model, and Win et al. (2007) for
a related RXLR classifier.
