**What it does**

Looks for the protein motif RXLR using the methodolgy described in Win et al. (2007).

The tool requires a protein sequence FASTA file as input, and produces a simple
tabular file as output with one line per protein.

Note that Win et al. (2007) used SignalP v2.0, which is no longer available.
The current release is SignalP v3.0 (Mar 5, 2007), so this is used instead (with the
Eukaryote model).

Declaring a protein to have an RXLR motif requires a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
score of at least 0.9, with the Neural Network predicted cleavage site between amino
acids 10 and 30, with an RXLR pattern after this and starting between amino acids 30
and 60. Additionally the position of any EER pattern after the RXLR is also reported.
