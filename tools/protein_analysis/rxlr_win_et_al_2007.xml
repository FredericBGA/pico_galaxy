**What it does**

Many effector proteins from Oomycete plant pathogens for manipulating the host have
been found to contain a signal peptide followed by a conserved RXLR motif (Arg, any
amino acid, Leu, Arg), and then sometimes EER (Glu, Glu, Arg). There are stiking
parallels with the malarial host-targeting signal.

This tool looks or the protein motif RXLR using the methodolgy described in Win et al.
(2007). It requires a protein sequence FASTA file as input, and produces a simple
tabular file as output with one line per protein.

Declaring a protein to have an RXLR motif requires a SignalP Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
score of at least 0.9, with the Neural Network predicted cleavage site between amino
acids 10 and 30, with an RXLR pattern after this and starting between amino acids 30
and 60. Additionally the position of any EER pattern after the RXLR is also reported.

Note that Win et al. (2007) used SignalP v2.0, which is no longer available. The
current release is SignalP v3.0 (Mar 5, 2007), so this is used instead (with the
Eukaryote model and sequences truncated at 70 amin acids).
