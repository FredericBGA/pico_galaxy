This package contains Galaxy wrappers for a selection of standalone command
line protein analysis tools:

* SignalP 3.0 and THMHMM 2.0, from the Center for Biological
  Sequence Analysis at the Technical University of Denmark,
  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cbs/

* WoLF PSORT v0.2 from http://wolfpsort.org/

To use these Galaxy wrappers you must first install the command line tools.
At the time of writing SignalP 3.0, TMHMM 2.0 and WoLF PSORT are free for
academic use.

These wrappers are copyright 2010-2011 by Peter Cock, James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the included LICENCE file for details.

Installation
============

1. Install the command line version of SignalP 3.0 and ensure "signalp" is
   on the PATH, see: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/

2. Install the command line version of TMHMM 2.0 and ensure "tmhmm" is on
   the PATH, see: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/

3. Install the WoLF PSORT v0.2 pacakge, and ensure "runWolfPsortSummary"
   is on the PATH (we use a wrapper script to change to the WoLF PSORT
   directory, run runWolfPsortSummary, and then change back to the original
   directory), see: http://wolfpsort.org/WoLFPSORT_package/version0.2/

4. Create a folder tools/protein_analysis under your Galaxy installation.

5. Copy/move the following files (from this archive) there:

tmhmm2.xml (Galaxy tool definition)
tmhmm2.py (Python wrapper script)
signalp3.xml (Galaxy tool definition)
signalp3.py (Python wrapper script)
wolf_psort.xml (Galaxy tool definition)
wolf_psort.py (Python wrapper script)
seq_analysis_utils.py (shared Python code)
README (optional)

6. Edit your Galaxy conjuration file tool_conf.xml (to use the tools) AND
   also tool_conf.xml.sample (to run the tests) to include the new tools
   by adding:

  <section name="Protein sequence analysis" id="protein_analysis">
    <tool file="protein_analysis/tmhmm2.xml" />
    <tool file="protein_analysis/signalp3.xml" />
    <tool file="protein_analysis/wolf_psort.xml" />
  </section>

7. Copy/move the following test files (from these archive) to Galaxy
   subfolder test-data:

four_human_proteins.fasta
four_human_proteins_signalp3.tabular
four_human_proteins_tmhmm2.tabular
empty.fasta
empty_tmhmm2.tabular
empty_signalp3.tabular

8. Run the Galaxy functional tests for these new wrappers with:

./run_functional_tests.sh -id tmhmm2
./run_functional_tests.sh -id signalp3

Alternatively, this should work (assuming you left the name and id as shown in
the XML file tool_conf.xml.sample):

./run_functional_tests.sh -sid Protein_sequence_analysis-protein_analysis

9. Restart Galaxy and check the new tools are shown and work.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial release
v0.0.2 - Corrected some typos in the help text
       - Renamed test output file to use Galaxy convention of *.tabular
v0.0.3 - Check for tmhmm2 silent failures (no output)
       - Additional unit tests
v0.0.4 - Ignore comment lines in tmhmm2 output.
v0.0.5 - Explicitly request tmhmm short output (may not be the default)
v0.0.6 - Improvement to how sub-jobs are run (should be faster)
v0.0.7 - Change SignalP default truncation from 60 to 70 to match the
         SignalP webservice.
v0.0.8 - Added WoLF PSORT wrapper to the suite.


Developers
==========

This script and other tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

This incorporates the previously used hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/seq_analysis

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf tmhmm_and_signalp.tar.gz tools/protein_analysis/LICENSE tools/protein_analysis/README tools/protein_analysis/suite_config.xml tools/protein_analysis/seq_analysis_utils.py tools/protein_analysis/signalp3.xml tools/protein_analysis/signalp3.py tools/protein_analysis/tmhmm2.xml tools/protein_analysis/tmhmm2.py tools/protein_analysis/wolf_psort.xml tools/protein_analysis/wolf_psort.py test-data/four_human_proteins.* test-data/empty.fasta test-data/empty_tmhmm2.tabular test-data/empty_signalp3.tabular
