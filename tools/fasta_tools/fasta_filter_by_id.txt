Galaxy tool to filter FASTA sequences by ID
===========================================

This tool is copyright 2010 by Peter Cock, SCRI, UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script (using the Galaxy library functions) which
divides a FASTA file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present in
the specified column(s) of a tabular file. Example uses include filtering based
on search results from a tool like NCBI BLAST, TMHMM or SignalP.

There are just two files to install:

* fasta_filter_by_id.py (the Python script)
* fasta_filter_by_id.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is next to the similarly names fasta_filter_by_length.py
and fasta_filter_by_length.xml files which are included with Galaxy, i.e.
in the Galaxy folder tools/fasta_tools

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. The suggested location is next to the fasta_filter_by_length.xml
entry. Simply add the line:

<tool file="fasta_tools/fasta_filter_by_id.xml" />

That's it.


History

v0.0.3 - Include FASTA in tool name

Developers
==========

These wrappers are currently being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/fasta_filter

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

tar -czf fasta_filter_by_id.tar.gz tools/fasta_tools/fasta_filter_by_id.*

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf fasta_filter_by_id.tar.gz
fasta_tools/fasta_filter_by_id.py
fasta_tools/fasta_filter_by_id.txt
fasta_tools/fasta_filter_by_id.xml
